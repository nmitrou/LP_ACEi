The text files included are from 5 rats that were recorded on 5 separate days. The date is listed as 12H01 etc. which means 2012, August, 01. 

Each day contains 4 text files: CTL, LP, CAPT, LPCAPT. 

\begin{enumerate}

	\item CTL is control during broadband forcing of blood pressure about 15 mmHg less that the animal's spontaneous blood pressure
	\item LP is the same as control except blood pressure is forced at 60-65 mmHg
	\item CAPT is same as control except after 1mg/kg bolus i.v. Captopril
	\item LPCAPT is the low pressure forcing with Captopril
\end{enumerate}

If there are other questions about the experimental details, the experiments were performed according to methods described here:
